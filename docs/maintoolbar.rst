============

The main toolbar consists of the following button:

    :align: center

The first four (“Run”, “Run for”, “Batch”, "Pause" and “Stop”) control the initiation and cessation of simulation runs. These commands can also be accessed from the “Command” menu. Further detail on these actions can be found in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.

The sixth and seventh buttons (“Reset” and “Reseed”) allow the resetting of the simulation and reseeding of the initial genomes in the population window prior to running a simulation. Further detail on these actions can be found in 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.

The eighth button (“Settings”) opens/closes the dockable settings panel.

The final button (“About”) displays the program information; including version number, authors, and license information.

The toolbar itself can be moved to one of four available positions using drag and drop: top (default), left, right, and bottom of the window. The toolbar can also be undocked from the main window and used as a floating toolbar (i.e. an independent window). To move the toolbar or to undock it as a floating window use the left mouse button on the three dotted handle (far right of the toolbar by default), then holding the mouse button down drag the window to it desired position.
