Requirements
============

REvoSim has no minimum requirements as such, and will run on most system [assumes we have a WIN/Linux/Mac version]; it however has not been tested on versions of Windows older than [insert Win version], Ubuntu [insert version], and Mac OS [insert version]. Performance will benefit from high processor speed and increased number of processor cores, with large amounts [give example] of available RAM recommended for large simulations. Graphics card performance is not relevant as GPUs are not currently used in the program's calculation pipeline. A fast hard drive is recommend when intensive logging is enabled; as slow I/O response time could affect the iteration cycle speed.
